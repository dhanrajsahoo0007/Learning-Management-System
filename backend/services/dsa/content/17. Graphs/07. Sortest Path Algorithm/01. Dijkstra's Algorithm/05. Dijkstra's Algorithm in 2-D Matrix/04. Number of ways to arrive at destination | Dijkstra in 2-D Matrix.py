But if you keep that line, the time complexity reduces to O(V^2 * logV).
Explain: Other neightbors may visit node u multiple times (up to O(V) times) and push node u to the minHeap. In the worst case, node u will pop and process O(V) times, each time it takes O(V) to visit neighbors, there is up to V nodes like node u. So total time complexity is O(V^3 * logV).
