"""
Problem: Path With Minimum Effort

    You are given a 2D array 'heights' where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col).
    Find a path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell that minimizes the maximum absolute
    difference in heights between consecutive cells of the path.

    Return the minimum effort required for such a path.

Time Complexity: O(m * n * log(m * n)), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid.
Space Complexity: O(m * n) for the result matrix and priority queue.

Constraints:
    - 1 <= m, n <= 100
    - 1 <= heights[i][j] <= 10^6
