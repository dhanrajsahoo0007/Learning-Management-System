Problem Statement:
    There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where 
    flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

    You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. 
    If there is no such route, return -1.

Time Complexity: O((N + E) * log(N)), where N is the number of cities and E is the number of flights.
                In the worst case, this could be O(N^2 * log(N)) if the graph is dense (i.e., there are flights between every pair of cities).

Space Complexity: O(N + E)
    - O(N) for the distances and stops arrays
    - O(E) for the graph adjacency list
    - O(N) for the priority queue in the worst case

The total space complexity is therefore O(N + E).

Similarity to Dijkstra's algorithm:

    Use of a priority queue to always explore the cheapest path first
    Maintaining a list of minimum costs to reach each node
    Exploring neighbors and updating costs


Key differences from standard Dijkstra:

    ***Addition of a stops counter
    **Allowing revisiting of nodes if we can reach them with fewer stops
    Early termination when we reach the destination (not necessarily finding all shortest paths)

The main difference is the handling of the 'k' constraint (maximum number of stops). 
In standard Dijkstra's algorithm, once we visit a node, we're guaranteed to have found the shortest path to that node. 
In this problem, we might find a cheaper path later that uses more stops, so we need to continue exploring.

This algorithm is sometimes referred to as a modified Dijkstra's algorithm or a BFS (Breadth-First Search) with a priority queue. It combines elements of both:
    From Dijkstra's: Use of a priority queue to always explore the cheapest path first
    From BFS: The level-wise exploration (here, levels correspond to the number of stop
